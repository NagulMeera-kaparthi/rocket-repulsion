##project title: rocket propulsion chat bot


##project description : I have created a informational "rocket propulsion chat bot" using Html and Qn maker,web app bot.it helps the user to find information about rocket propulsion and rocket propulsion and its history and about services.IN this website i provide all information about rocket propulsion and rocket propulsion.It's look a professional bot trying to solve the real world problem like in these days we are searching for good and genuine website,apps etc.for information here and there .so i makea try to give every details of rocket propulsion and rocket propulsion.My project that helps both learners and explorers like for learners and I provide every detail about rocket propulsion and rocket propulsion and for all explorers i gave website link and everthing there in the bot to know more to create deploy etc.





Types of Rocket Propulsion:-
The following are the different types of rocket propulsion:

1.Liquid-fuel chemical propulsion
2.Solid fuel chemical propulsion
3.Cold-gas chemical propulsion
4.Ion

Factors Affecting Rocketâ€™s Acceleration:-
1.The acceleration will be greater when the exhaust velocity ve of the gases is greater with respect to the rocket.
2.The acceleration is greater when the fuel in the rocket is burned faster.
3.As the mass of the rocket decreases, greater will the acceleration.

How Rocket Engines Work?
Modern rockets work by igniting a propellant. As the propellant is combusted, it is converted from a solid or liquid form into a gas. The gases produced have such a high volume, and are under such intense pressure from the heat of combustion, that they are pushed downward, through the nozzle, and out of the open end of the rocket at high velocities.

From there, Sir Isaac Newton takes over. Newton's third law of motion explains that, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that, simply stated, forces come in pairs. As the exhaust gas is pushed downward out of the bottom of the rockets, the gases also push the rocket upward with an equal and opposite force. The amount of force depends upon both the mass of the gases and the acceleration of the gases.
